This is acutally a museum of some of the larger and more complete past programs created over the years.  Most of the more modern examples are in individual repos and accept changes (from time to time).  There are more past examples of various languages, but this is a representative set.  Most of these have not been compiled since the late 90s or early 2000s, so not sure how functional they still are.

This set has a lot of games, which is still one of my favorite types of programs to write.  There are also seemingly random examples exploring how something works (eg. distributed computing).

 - QBasic
  * [TicTacToe](QBASIC/TicTacToe/readme.md)
  * [Pong](QBASIC/Pong/readme.md)
  * [SuperBreakout](QBASIC/SuperBreakout/readme.md)
 - Pascal
  * [TicTacToe](Pascal/TicTacToe/readme.md)
  * [Nibbles](Pascal/Nibbles/readme.md)
  * [Gorilla](Pascal/Gorilla/readme.md)
  * [KillerFish](Pascal/KillerFish/readme.md)
 - Perl
  * [Goldbach Conjecture](Perl/GoldbachConjecture/readme.md)
 - Delphi
  * [Nibbles](Delphi/Nibbles/readme.md)
  * [Othello](Delphi/Othello/readme.md)
  * [WebDev](Delphi/WebDev/readme.md)
 - Java
  * [TheatreLighting](Java/TheatreLighting/readme.md)
  * [Signatures](Java/Signatures/readme.md)
  * [Chat](Java/Chat/readme.md)
  * [DistributedClient](Java/DistributedClient/readme.md)
 - C
  * [Psuedo OS](C/PsuedoOS/readme.md)

There are no updates likely coming to these examples.  Unless I get inspired to clean up the code and try running in one of the various online QBASIC [qbjs](https://qbjs.org/) or Pascal editors.
